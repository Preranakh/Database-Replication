# Database-Replication(Proof of Concept)

Here in this project we have tried to set up two secure databases.  Steady state, the two databases have the same schema, and same data.  When data changes in one database, it will force changes in the other... and vice versa.


This folder contains our files included for database replication project. We have used C##_63710_GROUP_C and C##_63710_GROUP_D schemas which was provided to us. The files tables_and_data will load the tables and data into the schemas C and D. And the files replication_schema are for the database replication between schemas C and D. 

The video attached walks you through our whole project.
